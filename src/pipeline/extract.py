    Reads the contaminant data from the raw data folder. The data is in CSV format.
    The data contains 9 rows of metedata, which are skipped. These can be loaded in
    by adjusting the default value of the 'rows_to_skip' parameter, but will cause
    errors further down the pipeline if not handled correctly. Easier would be to
    inspect the .csv files manuallt if any metadata is needed. Or, read the metadata
    separately. The encoding is set to ISO-8859-15, as specified in the pdf:
